The SEC Form 13F is a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also known as the Information Required of Institutional Investment Managers Form. 
It is a quarterly filing required of institutional investment managers with over $100 million in qualifying assets. 
Companies required to file SEC Form 13F may include insurance companies, banks, pension funds, investment advisers and broker-dealers.

SEC Form 13F, which must be filed within 45 days of the end of each quarter, 
contains information about the investment manager and potentially a list of their recent investment holdings. 
The form was made famous by investment con artist Bernie Madoff. 
It provides investors with an inside look at the holdings of Wall Street's largest investment managers.

Bernard Lawrence "Bernie" Madoff (/ˈmeɪdɒf/;[1] born April 29, 1938) is an American fraudster and a former stockbroker, investment advisor, and financier. 
He is the former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market,[2] and the admitted operator of a Ponzi scheme that is considered the largest financial 
fraud in U.S. history.[3] Prosecutors estimated the size of the fraud to be $64.8 billion, based on the amounts in the accounts of 
Madoff's 4,800 clients as of November 30, 2008.[4]

Madoff founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960, and was its 
chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.[5][6] The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on 
Wall Street,[7] which bypassed "specialist" firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail 
brokers.[8] At the firm, he employed his brother Peter as senior managing director and chief compliance officer, 
Peter's daughter Shana Madoff, as the firm's rules and compliance officer and attorney, and his sons Andrew and Mark. 
Peter has since been sentenced to 10 years in prison[9] and Mark committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his father's arrest.[10][11][12] 
Andrew died of lymphoma on September 3, 2014.[13]
