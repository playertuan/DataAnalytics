# Activity 1 - Student Bio Page

* Create a simple bio page for yourself using the following HTML elements:

  * A header containing your name
  * An image for your picture (a placeholder is fine for now. include a basic description using the `alt` attribute)
  * Two paragraphs with text describing who you are
  * An unordered list of links to your social media pages
  * A table with three columns and some data on your favorite movies, songs, books, or activities

### Hints

* Dummy images can be found at [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/) and dummy text can be found at [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/). Focus on getting the entire page working before diving into more specific text and images.

### Bonuses

* Investigate how to link custom-made HTML pages to each other. Try creating a link from your newly-created bio page to one of the pages you created last class.
